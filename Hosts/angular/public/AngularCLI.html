    <p>The <code>--style</code> argument in the <code >N.G. new</code> command allows you to specify the style preprocessor to use for your new Angular project. By default, Angular uses CSS for styling, but you can also choose to use other style pre-processors like SCSS, SASS, or LESS by providing the <code>--style</code> argument followed by the desired pre-processor option.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to use SCSS for styling in your new Angular project, you can run the following command:</p>
    <pre>
      <code >N.G. new my-angular-app --style=scss
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>This will set up your project to use SCSS files for styling instead of the default CSS files. Using a pre-processor like SCSS allows for features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which can help you write cleaner and more structured stylesheets for your Angular project.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that once you have set the style pre-processor for your project using the <code>--style</code> argument, changing it later on may require manual adjustments to your project configuration. So, it's recommended to choose the desired style pre-processor at the beginning when creating a new Angular project.</p>
    <h4 id="verbose">--verbose</h4>
    <p>The <code>--verbose</code> flag in the <code >N.G. new</code> command is used to enable verbose logging during the creation of a new Angular project. When this flag is used, Angular CLI will output more detailed information about each step of the project creation process, including any warnings, errors, and other important messages that may occur.</p>
