            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>
                With over 20 years of experience as a software engineering leader and consultant, I specialize in transforming legacy codebases and guiding teams toward high performance. My background includes modernizing critical systems by designing forward-compatible abstractions, enabling incremental evolution without disrupting existing workflows. Through expert integration of modern platforms with legacy systems, I drive continuous business value while maintaining compatibility with established infrastructures.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Certified Professional Scrum Master and Agile Leader, I excel in mentoring teams to adopt agile principles effectively, with a focus on delivering business impact over technical complexity. I bring recent experience as a contractor and architect, leading the development of a scalable Paas and SaaS for Wellfit, integrating payment processing with legacy Practice Management Systems. This work has involved deploying a C# REST API in .NET Core, leveraging Azure for secure, scalable cloud hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My leadership approach is grounded in agile principles and cross-functional collaboration, with a track record of building cohesive teams across onshore and offshore settings. By focusing on streamlined development processes and fostering a culture of accountability, I consistently drive project success and team growth.
